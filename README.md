## Product vs project - modes of working

We have two modes of working: 

Product mode/kanban mode: we work on a best effort-basis without critical long-term due dates. The success criteria is to maximize the output of working software given the available capacity. We may still have long-term critical goals but we have flexibility in how the goals are achieved. For instance we may adjust scope to meet the deadline. 

Project mode: we work against a critical long-term due date. The success criteria is to have the project scope delivered in its whole. Missing part of the scope or missing the due date severely limits or even negates the delivered business value. 

It is important to understand that there is a whole spectrum between these two ways of working and most teams will have periods of product mode and other periods of project mode. In addition, project mode often comes in a variant where the due date is fixed whereas the scope or the cost may be negotiable.

We strive toward Product-mode of working for multiple reasons, including: 

- It tends to be more sustainable
- It stays true to the agile spirit of “reacting to change over following a plan”
- It builds upon and enforces trust between the vendor and the customer

Having said that, working in project mode can be extremely valuable and often it is the only meaningful thing in a given context.

Products and Projects have the following differences:
